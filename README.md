# 👋 Hi, I’m 白帆 (bakboem)

System Builder · Solo Founder  
AI-Orchestrated Software Architect based in Korea.

I no longer define myself as a “full-stack engineer.”

I design systems that enforce boundaries —  
and I use AI agents to build, test, and stress them.

I don’t write most of the execution code anymore.  
I design the structure, freeze the invariants, and let autonomous tooling implement within those constraints.

## 🧭 What I Build

### WorkFit — A Causality-Controlled Matching Engine

WorkFit is a real-time matching system built around:

- Time-bounded needs  
- Deterministic evaluation  
- Frozen state transitions  
- Replayable decisions  

It is not feed-based.  
It is not engagement-driven.

It is a system where:

> A decision must be explainable, auditable, and structurally irreversible.

Core model:

- Unidirectional semantic flow  
- Matching as the only source of fact  
- Lifecycle strictly separated from evaluation  
- Seat limits as frozen truth  
- Late evidence cannot rewrite history  

Every outcome is:

- Inspectable  
- Traceable  
- Non-retroactive

## 🏗 How I Build

I operate as a one-person system laboratory.

AI agents execute.  
I define constraints.

My workflow is:

1. Freeze invariants  
2. Define boundaries  
3. Split modules  
4. Orchestrate agents  
5. Verify causality  
6. Stress-test failure paths  

AI is not decision authority.  
It is execution force inside rule fences.

## 🧠 What Defines Me Now

I care less about writing features.  
I care about:

- Structural integrity under expansion  
- Semantic drift prevention  
- Cross-repo governance  
- Deterministic pipelines  
- Failure-first architecture design  

If a system cannot survive adversarial questioning,  
it is not finished.

## 🏗 Infrastructure Philosophy (Current State)

- Deterministic builds  
- No silent mutation  
- Lifecycle immutability  
- Deployment reproducibility  
- Observability separated from business plane  
- Single source of truth for evaluation  

Production ≈ Local  
Rules > Code  
Structure > Velocity

## 🤖 AI Usage Model

AI agents:

- Implement tasks  
- Run tests  
- Generate diffs  
- Stress boundary assumptions  

But:

- They do not define business invariants  
- They do not alter semantic contracts  
- They do not bypass lifecycle rules  

I am not coding faster.

I am designing systems that remain stable while being coded by machines.

## ⚡ Current Identity

I am a System Builder.

I build:

- Controlled-input architectures  
- Event-driven state machines  
- Explainable judgment engines  
- Governance-aware execution frameworks  

WorkFit is not just a product.

It is an experiment in:

> What happens when software decisions must respect causality?
