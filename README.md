### 👋 Welcome to my space

Hi, I’m **bakboem**, an independent full-stack developer and infrastructure engineer based in Korea, with a strong focus on building **automated systems**, **AI-integrated architectures**, and **resilient backend platforms**.

---

### 🧱 What I'm working on

- 🚀 **AI-powered World Engine**:  
  A structured DSL-based system for narrative world generation and agent-driven storytelling. I'm building a platform where structured world logic meets LLM creativity.

- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**:  
  Designing and managing infrastructure-as-code systems using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **AWS**, and **GitHub Actions**.  
  Emphasis on **ephemeral testing environments**, **multi-region failover**, and **event-driven triggers**.

- 🔁 **Self-hosted LLM workflows**:  
  Exploring **model quantization (GGUF)**, **LoRA fine-tuning**, and **agent orchestration** over **llama.cpp** + **OpenRouter** hybrid setups.

- 🧩 **Composable backend systems**:  
  Building services in **Go**, orchestrated through **Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL**, and managed via structured logging and metrics (**Fluentd + Prometheus + Grafana**).

---

### 🧠 Interests & Focus

- Building **DSLs** for world simulation and narrative systems  
- **AI-assisted code/infra generation** and deployment  
- Dynamic **multi-agent orchestration** for storytelling, simulation, and dev workflows  
- Cross-platform system automation, low-overhead deployment (Docker + Alpine + GitHub Actions)

---

### 🤝 Collaboration & Research

I'm open to connecting with engineers, writers, and AI researchers interested in:

- ✳️ Autonomous narrative agents  
- ✳️ Hybrid symbolic/LLM systems  
- ✳️ Low-cost LLM inference in cloud/on-prem environments  
- ✳️ High-concurrency, state-driven infrastructure
