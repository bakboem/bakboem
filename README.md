# 👋 Welcome to my space

Hi, I’m **bakboem（白帆）**, a full-stack engineer and infra architect based in Korea.  
I build **high-automation backend systems**, **AI-augmented workflows**, and **resilient cloud platforms** — solo, end-to-end.

Right now I'm executing a **three-pillar strategy**:

---

## 🧭 What I'm building now

### **1️⃣ SenkNet — 匹配平台（业务主线）**
A matching-first social platform for foreigners in Korea.  
Not a “timeline community” — it's a **real-time matching engine** powered by:

- 🔖 Structured tagging, event analysis, user preference modeling  
- ⚡ Kafka / NATS event streaming  
- 🌐 Multilingual ecosystem (CN / EN / KR)  
- 🔄 Worker + WebSocket full pipeline  
- 💰 Planned membership + coin economy

This is the **core business** and long-term product I'm most invested in.

### **2️⃣ SenkNet Infrastructure — 完整自动化的云与本地环境**
A reproducible, tightly-controlled infrastructure stack:

- AWS → migrated to a **low-cost, high-reliability single-server architecture (t4g + Compose)**  
- GitHub Actions → ECR → ArgoCD (or local stack)  
- PostgreSQL 18 built from source + dedicated EC2 EBS data layer  
- Prometheus / Loki / Grafana → complete observability plane  
- Kafka (KRaft) + NATS → event-driven backbone  
- Local / test / prod → **100% configuration parity**

Goal:  
> **Enterprise-grade infra, operated by one person.**

---

### **3️⃣ Senk AI Agents — 未来的产品线（长期）**
I'm building an **agent-native world and content ecosystem**:

- Matching logic exposed as APIs for external AI Agents  
- Multi-Agent structured workflows  
- DSL-based world and system rules  
- Automated translation / moderation / matching / routing

This line becomes SenkNet’s **second growth curve**.

---

## 🧠 Interests & Focus

- High-concurrency matching systems  
- Agentic apps (matching, translation, moderation, narrative)  
- DSL × AI world/simulation frameworks  
- Automated CI/CD & self-hosted pipelines  
- Multilingual content ecosystems (CN / KR / EN)

## 🛠️ Tech stack

| Area | Tools |
|------|------|
| Infra | Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions, ECR, EC2, EBS |
| Backend | Go, PostgreSQL 18, Kafka, NATS, Redis/ElastiCache |
| Observability | Fluent-bit, Loki, Prometheus Agent, Grafana |
| Frontend | Next.js App Router, SSR, multilingual routing |
| Automation | Docker Compose, Make, bash pipelines |
| AI | OpenAI API, workflow automation, future MCP agents |

---

## 🤝 Looking to connect

Open to connecting with people who work on:

- Multilingual platforms  
- Matching engines  
- Agent-native systems  
- AI × Infra  
- DSL-based narrative/simulation engines

## ⚡ Fun fact

> I believe the next generation of software will be shaped by **AI Agents + stateful systems** —  
> and SenkNet is my way of building that future ahead of time.
